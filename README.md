# arkmods


This is a collection of my three working mods (FloatingDesert, ScorchedCenter, DesertEngrams) and the one work in progress mod (AlpacaTech). I am releasing this into the public domain.

I will offer no support and do not wish to be contacted. The reason I am releasing this into the public domain is as an act of kindness to other mod developers who are interested in working examples and for server admins that may want to continue to run one of these mods on their servers.
